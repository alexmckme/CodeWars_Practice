# CodeWars Challenges: [visit my profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/alexmckme)

This repository is filled with CodeWars challenges (also named katas). I push solutions up to 7 times a week as part of a practice routine. Because data structures and algorithms can be fun!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  JavaScript

Every night before going to sleep, I solve at least 1 problem. The joy of solving algorithms is the best sleeping pill!

## Lessons Learned:

Aside from getting better at data structures and methods, I learned that there is no one solution to coding challenges, there are always many ways of achieving the same result. Therefore, I consistently strive to write cleaner code, and find more efficient solutions.
